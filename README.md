# ESP32-CAM_PSRAM_CameraServer

CamWebServer adapted for ESP32-CAM PSRAM 1.3 + OV5640 Autofocus support + OV2640 support.
this is mainly a mix between :
- CameraWebServer exemple script from arduino IDE
- OV5640 Autofocus script from ESP
- OV2640 was already built in
- pinout configuration for ESP32-CAM PSRAM

  How to use :
  extract in a folder in the documents\arduino folder
  build and upload

  follow in serial Monitor.

Known bug : 
  - OV5640 have stripes / Bad quality

    
  I've made this for my personnal use, but feel free to optimize it !
  I'm no dev, so there are bugs :D
